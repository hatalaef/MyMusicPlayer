Notes
    Changed adapter view to SongPos. If I'm careful about updating the adapter when the View changes, I think it should work?
    Sometimes there is an IllegalStateException, which seems to mean the Media Player isn't in the right state. (Maybe fixed)
    Not that much of a problem, but OnCompletion Listener is called hitting play right away, which means the second song plays.

Layout
    I guess the now playing songs list should be separate from the views, so they can play no matter what
