Stuff to Do!

    Get view for other methods of play
        -playlist, all songs
        -eventually by genre/artist/etc.
        -change so nowplaying only shows songs that are playing, duh
    Playlists
    Editing
		-Tagging
		-Deleting
		-Renaming
		-Moving
    Notification that goes away
        -or, notification that has actions on it
	Album Art
	For the car

    Computer syncing
	
	Database
		Filepath as primary key, or autoincrement?
		Filepath should just be the end, so it can be identical on phone and computer.
		i.e. /filename.mp3 or playlists/filename.m3u, then it would work as a primary key
		eh, seems too hard to do
    
Notes
    Changed adapter view to SongPos. If I'm careful about updating the adapter when the View changes, I think it should work?
    Sometimes there is an IllegalStateException, which seems to mean the Media Player isn't in the right state. (Maybe fixed)
    Not that much of a problem, but OnCompletion Listener is called hitting play right away, which means the second song plays.

Layout
    I guess the now playing songs list should be separate from the views, so they can play no matter what
